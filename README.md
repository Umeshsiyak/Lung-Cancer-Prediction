**Lung-Cancer-Prediction**
This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on demographic, lifestyle, and medical risk factors. Early detection is critical for effective treatment, and this project demonstrates how ML can aid in risk assessment and proactive healthcare decision-making.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes features such as:
Age
Gender
Smoking history
Yellow fingers
Chronic disease
Wheezing
Chest pain
And other relevant risk factors

**Machine Learning Models**
The following models were trained and evaluated:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree Classifier
The Decision Tree Classifier achieved the highest accuracy, showing strong performance in capturing patterns in the dataset.


**Key Highlights
Easy-to-use Python scripts for lung cancer prediction
Helps identify high-risk individuals for early medical attention
Demonstrates practical ML workflow: preprocessing → training → evaluation → visualization
